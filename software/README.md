# Software 
This software folder contains a precompiled file for simplest set up, and the arduino sketch to make changes to the software. Below are instructions for how to program your OpenDosimeter. 

## Programming the Raspberry Pi Pico
### Default Settings
**If you don't want to change the code and just want to program the pico with default settings follow these steps!**
1. Download the [OpenDosimeter.uf2](https://github.com/OpenDosimeter/OpenDosimeter/blob/main/software/OpenDosimeter.uf2) file in the software file
2. Use the micro-USB connection to plug the Raspberry Pi Pico into a computer
3. When the file manager window pops up, drag the [OpenDosimeter.uf2](https://github.com/OpenDosimeter/OpenDosimeter/blob/main/software/OpenDosimeter.uf2) file into the directory. Your device should restart and is now ready for callibration.

### Modifying the Code
**Here's how you can modify the provided code**
1. Download Arduino
2. Download Arduino-Pico so your computer recognizes the Raspberry Pi Pico
3. Download the folder [OpenDosimeter_ino](https://github.com/OpenDosimeter/OpenDosimeter/tree/main/software/OpenDosimeter_ino)
