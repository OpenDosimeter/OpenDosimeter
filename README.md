# OpenDosimeter

Our open-source hardware and software dosimeter offers an afordable solution for real-time, self-monitored X-ray radiation exposure. With a total component cost of roughly $90, this device provides an accessible option for radiation monitoring to promote broad access to radiation safety. This project is a derivative of the [Open Gamma Detector](https://github.com/OpenGammaProject/Open-Gamma-Detector), with the main new feature being the effective dose calculations (in Sieverts) from the detected spectrum.

> **SAFETY DISCLAIMER:** This is a research project; builders and users assume full responsibility for verifying the accuracy and reliability of measurements obtained from the dosimeters they build. Always follow proper radiation safety protocols and consult with qualified professionals when dealing with radiation exposure.

## Key Features 
- **Open Design:** The hardware and software are fully open-source, enabling customization and personalization to enhance and broaden the capabilities of the dosimeter
- **Compact Format:** 73 mm x 42 mm x 23 mm (with the case)
- **Easily Programmable:** Drag and drop firmware files
- **Dose range:** Currently reliable between around 0.5 uSv/h to 1 mSv/h (Â±20% accuracy) in the [photon counting](https://github.com/OpenDosimeter/OpenDosimeter/blob/main/README.md#working-principle) range (technical paper showing this coming soon on arXiv)
- **Buzzer:** Built in buzzer allows for optional audible warnings when radiation exposure exceeds predefined limit (default off)
- **Local Calibration:** Using Am-241 from an ionization household smoke detector, the device can be calibrated for accurate dose calculations
- **Real-time:** Instantly read out radiation exposure levels, eliminating the need for specialized read-out facilities, pre-existing infrastructure, and monthly subscription fees (e.g., for OSL or TLD badges)
- **Data Logging:** Storage of dose rates and accumulated dose for the last 10 hours on the device (1 s sampling).
- **Affordable:** Total cost of building an OpenDosimeter is around $90 (see cost breakdown below)

## How to Make One 
**This repository has everything you need to create your own OpenDosimeter:** 

**[Case](https://github.com/OpenDosimeter/OpenDosimeter/tree/main/case):** Use this directory to 3D print the case. It contains two sets of ``.stl`` files that can be downloaded to print top and bottom components for a case with and without a belt clip. 

**[Docs](https://github.com/OpenDosimeter/OpenDosimeter/tree/main/docs):** This is where you can find the reference images used throughout this repository. 

**[Software](https://github.com/OpenDosimeter/OpenDosimeter/tree/main/software):** The software directory has everything you need to program your device, whether you are just looking to download the software with default settings or looking to modify the firmware and make changes to the sketch.  After programming your device, you will be guided through local calibration of your device and an overview of how to use it. 

**[Hardware](https://github.com/OpenDosimeter/OpenDosimeter/tree/main/hardware):** Check out the hardware directory to see the OpenDosimeter board layout in EasyEDA and instructions for ordering it using JLCPCB. This directory contains a breakdown of each component required to assemble the hardware with prices and links to order parts. Furthermore, this is where you can find instructions to assemble your device. 
Additionally, if you prefer to order directly from the PCB manufacturer, you can download the gerber file also located in the ``hardware`` directory. 


**[@OpenDosimeter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCUE-LeyRK8Y6H67ti1gdNA):** Finally, head over to our YouTube channel for instructional manuals on ordering the PCB, assembling, programming, and calibrating the device.

## Working Principle 
The flow chart below illustrates the operation, using grey boxes to represent hardware components and orange boxes to indicate software functionality (inspired by the [Open Gamma Detector flowchart](https://github.com/OpenGammaProject/Open-Gamma-Detector/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#working-principle), demonstrating the similarity of the underlying design). The current software version (1.0) implements photon-counting capabilities (excellent for low to medium dose rates). A parallel energy-integrating component (for medium to high dose rates)is under development for the upcoming software version 1.1.

## Troubleshooting and FAQ
Refer to [REFERENCE.md](https://github.com/OpenDosimeter/OpenDosimeter/blob/main/REFERENCE.md) for troubleshooting support and guidance in debugging.

## Future Improvements
1. The current power switch on the OpenDosimeter board is fragile and sometimes breaks. Future iterations of the hardware should replace for a more durable model.
2. In order to make an even more integrated and compact design, the RP2040 chip from the Raspberry Pi Pico could be incorporated into the OpenDosimeter board.
