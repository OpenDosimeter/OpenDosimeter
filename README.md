## How to Make One 
Check out the ``hardware`` for instructions to order the PCB, get the ``.stl`` files to 3D print the case, and find links to all other components. Additionally, you can find step by step instructions for assembling the device, programming and calibrating it, and a device overview over on our YouTube channel [@OpenDosimeter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCUE-LeyRK8Y6H67ti1gdNA). 

## Working Principle 
<span style="color: red;">If we want this section, we should create a flow chart that explains how the device works</span>

## Hardware 
Our hardware has been designed using EasyEDA. The ``hardware`` folder contains all the files needed and instructions for odering the board. Additionally, if you prefer to order directly from the PCB manufacturer, you can download the gerber file also located in the (``hardware``)[https://github.com/OpenDosimeter/OpenDosimeter/tree/main/hardware] folder. 
## Software 

## Troubleshooting and FAQ

## Known Limitations 
1. The power switch is fragile and can easily be broken if pressed too hard. Future iterations of the hardware could feature a power button similar to the side button which would increase the durability and longevity of the device.
